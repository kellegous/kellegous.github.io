## About This Site

My primary site is [kellegous.com](http://www.kellegous.com/) and that's where I try to publish content that is a bit more polished. Well, I aspire to making it polished. This site is definitely not intended to be polished. This site is my own personal notes. You are certainly welcome to follow along, you can even do so in early 2000's [RSS style](/index.xml) if you wish. But do keep in mind that the primary audience for this site is me.
